<h1>short list of software recommendations</h1>
<p>Here's software that I use often, highly recommend, have no affiliation with, and doesn't seem to be super well known or understood.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use a password manager</strong>. Choices related to security are usually a trade-off between convenience and security, but password managers increase both in the long run. I happen to use <a href="https://bitwarden.com/">Bitwarden</a> and it's great; it has an excellent free tier and can optionally be self-hosted. I've also heard good things about <a href="https://1password.com/">1password</a> and <a href="https://keepass.info/">KeePass</a>. I recommend avoiding password managers built into a specific operating system or browser in case you want your passwords to be available elsewhere in the future.</li>
<li><strong>Depend on search features</strong>. I sometimes see people spend a lot of time deciding which folder to put a file/bookmark/etc. into, and also a lot of time searching through their folders for something. Many applications have great search features that allow you to spend little to no time organizing but still quickly find what you need. Find these search features and make use of them to save tons of time. Some applications have significantly better search features than others; consider this when choosing between apps.</li>
<li><strong>Separate how you keep track of events and tasks</strong>. If you use apps, use one app that specializes in being the best calendar, and another app that specializes in being the best to do list. Trying to combine them will slow you down.</li>
<li><strong>Run automated backups</strong>. This is different from syncing. If you only sync your files, the accidental loss of important files will also sync. But with good backup software, you will have multiple copies of all your important files, each from a different time. Having automated backups can also give you the freedom to take more risks and save time. <a href="https://www.duplicati.com/">Duplicati</a> backing up to <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/">Backblaze B2 Cloud Storage</a> has been working well for me, and there are other options out there that are easier to use but have fewer features or cost more. At the time of writing, I'm paying about $0.02 USD per month to back up about 33 GB.</li>
<li><strong>Back up your emails</strong>. If you use Gmail or a similar email service, you can set up automated backing up of your emails by connecting it to any local email client (such as <a href="https://www.thunderbird.net">Thunderbird</a>). If you're interested, I recommend searching online for a guide for exactly how to do this (you may need to change an email setting).</li>
<li>For Windows users: <a href="https://www.fourth-wall.co.uk/post/powertoys-11-awesome-features-microsoft-won-t-add-to-windows">PowerToys</a>, a collection of extremely helpful tools made by Microsoft, such as for resizing images, bulk file renaming, creating custom keyboard shortcuts, changing what your mouse buttons do, window management, and much more.</li>
</ul>
<h2>research</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://unpaywall.org/">Unpaywall</a> for automatically and legally finding free copies of paywalled scholarly articles.</li>
