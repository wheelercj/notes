<h1>SMART goals</h1>
<p>Goals should be as specific as possible in terms of the what, when, why, and how of each goal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Specific — Can you break the goal down into smaller goals?</li>
<li>Measurable — How will you track your progress? Make sure it will feel to you like you are making progress when you are.</li>
<li>Attainable — What are the odds you will reach your goal? Think realistically about your abilities, and be prepared to make changes gradually instead of all at once.</li>
<li>Relevant — How does this goal connect to your long-term plans?</li>
<li>Time-bounded — When will you start, when will you finish, and/or what days and times will you schedule to work on this goal?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>Keep yourself accountable. To ensure that you stick to the goals you set, it is important to make a concrete, specific plan for how you will keep yourself accountable.  A friend or trusted colleague can help with this.  For example, knowing that a colleague will be asking you about your progress may give you an incentive to complete your goal.
