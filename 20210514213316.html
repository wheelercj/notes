<h1>short list of software recommendations</h1>
<p>Here's software that I use often, highly recommend, and doesn't seem to be super well known or understood (and that I have no affiliation with.)</p>
<h2>relevant to everyone</h2>
<ul>
<li>Separate how you keep track of events and tasks. If you use apps, use one app that specializes in being the best calendar, and another app that specializes in being the best to do list. Trying to combine them will slow you down.</li>
<li>A password manager. Choices related to security are usually a trade-off between convenience and security, but password managers increase both in the long run. There are many good ones; I happen to use <a href="https://bitwarden.com/">Bitwarden</a> and it's great.</li>
<li>Automated backups. This is different from syncing; with good backup software, you will have multiple copies of all your important files, each from a different time. (If you only use syncing, the loss of important files will also sync.) Having automated backups gives you freedom to take more risks and save time. <a href="https://www.duplicati.com/">Duplicati</a> has been working well for me, but there are other options out there that are easier to use.</li>
</ul>
<h2>computer science</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.sublimemerge.com/">Sublime Merge</a> for version control with Git. I used to use Git Bash, but it forces you to type a command to do each little thing. Sublime Merge immediately shows what you're most likely to need by default, and makes committing and comparing differences much easier.</li>
</ul>
<h2>research</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://unpaywall.org/">Unpaywall</a> for automatically and legally finding free copies of paywalled scholarly articles.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a> for managing citations and scholarly articles.</li>
<li><a href="20200319163500.html">[ยง] the Zettelkasten Method</a> for taking notes, organizing ideas, and brainstorming.</li>
</ul>
